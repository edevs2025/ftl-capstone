## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

Finishd MVP!

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

While trying to connect the front to backend, we faced problems with Render and Supabase connection

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

 We finished everything we planned for this week early in the week so we started working for our stretch features. We are prioritizing something that the user would like to use to implement first.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

We used MUI alongside with OAI API key for our ai respones. We all also used the OAI UI to help with bugs in our code.

We also want to thank our classmates and mentors for all the support they gave us this week and ultimately the whole program.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 Something at risk is if user want to talk to a real human. We will change to the fact that our site is 24/7, on-demand usage.
