# Project Proposal

Pod Members: **Bailey Williams, Christopher Adneiji, Kenneth Jiang**

## Problem Statement

Many individuals, particularly young adults, experience significant anxiety and stress when preparing for behavioral interviews. Traditional mock interview resources often lack real-time, personalized feedback and are not always accessible or effective in reducing interview-related anxiety. The primary target audience for this project is young adults who are entering the job market or transitioning to new career opportunities. This includes recent graduates, individuals preparing for internships, and young professionals seeking career advancement. Additionally, the platform aims to be inclusive and beneficial for anyone who needs interview practice, including career changers, unemployed individuals, and those re-entering the workforce after a break.

## User Roles

Interviewee: Person coming to the website to practice their interviewing skills and learn what they do well/need to improve on.

## User Personas

- Bailey is an unemployed person (of any age) looking to get a Job. While his resume is good enough to get past the screens, he hasn't been able to get past the behavioral interviews. He came to this site because he wants on-demand practice with interviewing that gives him feedback immediately. He doesn't if his shortcombings are rooting in his anxiety caused by the human interviewer or the fact that he just needs interviewing practice. This site will help him develop a routine with interviewing that allows him to get past the cause of his failures whatever they may be.

## User Stories

Include at least 10 user stories.

1. As an interviewee, I want to be able to save my progress, so that I can see whether or not I'm making improvements.
2. As an interviewee, I want to see my cumulative interview stats in a dashboard so I can understand what I need (or don't need) to focus on.
