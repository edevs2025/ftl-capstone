## Problem Statement

Many individuals, particularly young adults, experience significant anxiety and stress when preparing for behavioral interviews. Traditional mock interview resources often lack real-time, personalized feedback and are not always accessible or effective in reducing interview-related anxiety. 
The primary target audience for this project is young adults who are entering the job market or transitioning to new career opportunities. This includes recent graduates, individuals preparing for internships, and young professionals seeking career advancement. Additionally, the platform aims to be inclusive and beneficial for anyone who needs interview practice, including career changers, unemployed individuals, and those re-entering the workforce after a break.

## Description/Expected Features List

The main purpose of the project is to provide a supportive and anxiety-free platform for individuals to practice behavioral interviews.
